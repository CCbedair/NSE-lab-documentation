## Thesis report

The final report can be organized as follows:

### Introduction
Provide the background, state the objectives of the project, delimitations, and outline the rest of the report.

### Theory
If the system is based on some relevant theory, such as cryptography, database theory, operating system theory, networking theory, etc, that theory can be presented here.

### The system under consideration
Describe the functionality and technology of the system under consideration

### Threat modeling methodology
Describe how you go about the threat modeling task. Convince the reader that your methodology ensures that you don't miss any important attacks.

### Threats
Describe each relevant attack vector in the general case (not specifically related to your system under consideration). Refer to solid sources (e.g. papers or presentations to security conferences). This is your threat literature review. 

### Threat model of the system under consideration
Describe your assessment of each threat as applied to your system. Estimate the potential impact and the probability of successful exploitation. Choose a limited set of attack vectors for the penetration testing phase of the project.

### Discussion
Discuss the generalizability, reliability and validity of your findings.

### Penetration testing task #1

#### Introduction
- Describe the attack vector to be explored

#### Method
- Describe how the testing is performed

#### Theory
- If the attack vector is based on particular theory (e.g. SQL injection requires some database theory), then that theory can be described here.

#### Results
- Describe your findings

#### Discussion
- Discuss the generalizability, reliability and validity of your findings.

### Penetration testing task #2
...

### Penetration testing task #n
...

### Discussion
Summarize the generalizability, reliability and validity of your findings.

### Conclusions
How secure is the system?
