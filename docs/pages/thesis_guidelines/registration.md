# Registration

Registration differs between programs. Therefore, you will need to consult your program coordinator to bring about the registration. However, you will normally also need to find a supervisor and and an examiner. For hacking projects at the NSE department, talk to Prof. Pontus Johnson about supervision, and Mathias Ekstedt or Robert Lagerstr√∂m about examiners (for some programs, examiners may be appointed without your involvement). 

Different programs will demand different information, specifications or project plans as a basis for approval of the thesis project.
