# Delimitations

In order to firmly conclude that a system is secure, it is important to be comprehensive. However, a truly comprehensive security audit may be beyond the scope of the thesis project. Therefore, delimitations can be made, excluding certain components of the system as well as certain attack surfaces. Note that delimitations must be motivated. If you choose to ignore an important attack surface, you won't be able to answer the question regarding the the actual security of the system. Thus, the relevance of your results are diminished. Furthermore, within the stated delimitations, comprehensiveness is important. Thus, if you choose to focus only on the Bluetooth protocol, make sure you explore the whole attack surfaces of that protocol. If you do not, then you risk not being able to provide any solid answer regarding the security of the system.
