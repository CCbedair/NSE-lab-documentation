# Related work

You need to demonstrate to the reader that you have a good understanding of the previous work in the domain. You can do that in the threat modeling section of your report. Describe each relevant attack vector in the general case (not specifically related to the product that you are investigating, but rather the class of such products). Refer to sources (e.g. papers or presentations at security conferences, blogs etc.). 

To convince the reader that you have considered all relevant attacks, make sure to present a significant number of references to previous attacks (presentations on hacker conferences such as DefCon and BlackHat, CVEs, blog posts, etc). Another good idea is to refer to a comprehensive taxonomy or list of attacks, such as [OWASP's Testing Guide](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Project), [The Cyber Security Body Of Knowledge (CyBOK)](https://www.cybok.org), [Mitre's CAPEC](https://capec.mitre.org), [Hezam et al.](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mohammed_Mahyoub2/publication/324149744_A_Comprehensive_IoT_Attacks_Survey_based_on_a_Building-blocked_Reference_Mode/links/5c597814299bf1d14cad8808/A-Comprehensive-IoT-Attacks-Survey-based-on-a-Building-blocked-Reference-Mode.pdf), [Mitre's ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org), [OWASP's Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), [OWASP's Top 10 Mobile](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/), [HackerOne's taxonomy](https://www.hackerone.com/top-10-vulnerabilities), or similar in order to demonstrate that you have considered all relevant attacks.
