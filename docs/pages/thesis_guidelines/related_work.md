You need to demonstrate to the reader that you have a good understanding of the previous work in the domain. You can do that in the threat modeling section of your report. Describe each relevant attack vector in the general case (not specifically related to your system under consideration). Refer to solid sources (e.g. papers or presentations to security conferences). This is your threat literature review; to convince the reader that you have considered all relevant attacks, make sure to present a significant number of references to previous attacks (presentations on hacker conferences such as DefCon and BlackHat, CVEs, blog posts, etc). Another good idea is to refer to a comprehensive taxonomy or list of attacks, such as OWASP's Testing Guide, Mitre's CAPEC, Hezam et al., Mitre's ATT&CK, OWASP's taxonomy, HackerOne's taxonomy, or similar in order to demonstrate that you have considered all relevant attacks.
