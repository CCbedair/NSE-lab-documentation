# Threat traceability matrix

A threat traceability matrix is an excellent structure for presenting your threat analysis as well as the results of your penetration testing. Ideally, you would include the following information in your threat traceability matrix:

 - the threat agent,
 - the affected asset,
 - the attack,
 - the attack surface,
 - the attack goal,
 - the attack impact, if successful,
 - potential security controls,
 - references to related work, e.g. to vulnerabilities in similar products, or to descriptions of the kind of vulnerability and/or exploit,
 - whether you have attempted this attack (if you have, refer the reader to the appropriate section; if you haven't, refer the reader to the location in the report where you motivate that delimitation),
 - estimated probability of success 
 - the confidence of your success probability assessment (refer the reader to the location in the report where you motivate your degree of confidence).
