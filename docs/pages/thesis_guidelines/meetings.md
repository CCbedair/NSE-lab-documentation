# Tutoring meetings

During spring 2020, Pontus Johnson offers tutoring meetings in the main seminar room of the NSE department, Malvinas v√§g 6A, 4th floor, every Friday at 09:00-10:00 for those who would like to meet IRL. Some sessions may be cancelled or rescheduled. If so, that is communicated via ssas-students.slack.com.
