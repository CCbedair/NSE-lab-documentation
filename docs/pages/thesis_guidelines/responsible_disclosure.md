# Responsible disclosure

A discovered vulnerability should be reported to the vendor. The vendor should then be given the opportunity to develop a patch. After the patch has been published, or in the case of an unresponsive vendor, after a certain time passes, the finding should be reported to the National Vulnerability Database and made public. The US CERT offers a good [Guide to
Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/SpecialReport/2017_003_001_503340.pdf). Your supervisor can assist you in the reporting process.
