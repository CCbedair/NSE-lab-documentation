# Documentation for NSE Lab

The files in the `/docs` folder are the contents of the website
[nse.digital](http://nse.digital). Markdown files in `/docs` are automatically
generated as HTML files on the website. The home page of the website is
`/docs/README.md`. The website uses the Jekyll theme
[Just The Docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/). It should be quite
clear from looking through the `/docs` folder how the site works and is
structured, but
[this](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/navigation-structure/)
page in the Just The Docs documentation should help explain things in detail.
